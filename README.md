[This](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/google-golang) is a Coursera specialization in GoLang for intermediate programmers. Individuals with proficiency in any programming language can take this course. It is a 3 course specialization.

This specialization is a for programmers that want to understand the Basics of GoLang and its important feature, Concurrency. It is being taught by [Ian Harris](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~harris/)

This specialization consists of 3 courses
1. [Getting Started with Go](https://www.coursera.org/learn/golang-getting-started)
2. [Functions, Methods, and Interfaces in Go](https://www.coursera.org/learn/golang-functions-methods)
3. [Concurrency in Go](https://www.coursera.org/learn/golang-concurrency)

This is an excellent course so far and highly recommended if you are interested in learning ins and outs of GoLang.

The repo contains the code samples which are my implementation of some problems that are part of this specialization.
