[This](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/google-golang) is a Coursera specialization in GoLang. Individuals with proficiency in any one programming language are advisable to take this course. It is a 3 course specialization.

This specialization is for programmers that want to understand GoLang and its most important feature, Concurrency. It is being taught by [Ian Harris](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~harris/)

This specialization consists of 3 courses
1. [Getting Started with Go](https://www.coursera.org/learn/golang-getting-started)
2. [Functions, Methods, and Interfaces in Go](https://www.coursera.org/learn/golang-functions-methods)
3. [Concurrency in Go](https://www.coursera.org/learn/golang-concurrency)

This is an excellent course so far and highly recommended if you are interested in learning GoLang.

The repo contains the code samples which are my implementation of some problems that are part of this specialization.
